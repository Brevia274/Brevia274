 Aspiring Pentester | Learning Cybersecurity

 I’m just starting my journey in cybersecurity, but I’m very determined to become a penetration tester. I’m eager to learn ethical hacking, security tools, and eventually join a Red Team.

 What I’m Learning:
 • Basic pen-testing (web, network, API)
 • Cybersecurity fundamentals (vulnerabilities, OWASP Top 10)
 • Tools: Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Metasploit
 • Scripting: Learning Python & Bash
 • CTF challenges & labs

 My Progress:
 • Taking courses on TryHackMe and Hack The Box
 • Practicing CTF challenges
 • Sharing what I learn here
