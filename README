# Welcome!

I'm currently transitioning into the field of cybersecurity, with a special interest in penetration testing.

I'm learning through platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box, and I’m building my skills in networking, Linux, and ethical hacking. This GitHub will be my learning journal, where I’ll share notes, CTFs, projects, and progress.

Feel free to follow along ^^
